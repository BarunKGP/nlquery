# nlQuery
nlQuery is a natural language query engine for your data. Connect to your data sources and enter queries in natural language. We are also working on charting and visualization features from natural language. nlQuery also enables live, interactive dashboards by periodically refreshing data.


> [!WARNING]
> At nlQuery, we are actively working on the implementation of several features. This is not a stable project and things might break until our first release.
